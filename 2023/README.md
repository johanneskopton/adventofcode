# 2023

This time, it will be messy.. I try to do the first star decently and then the second star as fast as possible (minimize the time between stars).

Rules:

* solution before next day's puzzle is out
* no speculative solution of possible star 2 tasks before having access to task 2 task
* as little googling as possible (preferably use [Zeal](https://github.com/zealdocs/zeal))
* obviously no peeking at the puzzle / other peoples solutions
* obviously no generative AI (sorry, Copilot)
